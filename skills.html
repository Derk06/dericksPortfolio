                <p>
                    I posess both mechanical and electrical skills which are needed to produce mechatronic systems. My first experience of mechanical
                    designing was learning from random youtube tutorials on how various mechanical systems work like a 4 bar linkage. After learning a bit about mechanical
                    designs, I began learning electrical circuits from a udmey course where I gained a comprehensive understanding of electrical engineering and 
                    electronics fundamentals, including key concepts like voltage and current. I learned about electric circuits, the differences between direct 
                    current (DC) and alternating current (AC), and the roles of resistors, capacitors, and inductors in circuits. The course also coversed electricity 
                    sources and techniques for simplifying resistive, capacitive, and inductive circuits. I mastered basic circuit analysis using Kirchhoff's laws, 
                    nodal and loop analysis, and advance to more complex techniques like the superposition theorem, Th√©venin's theorem, and Norton's theorem. 
                    Additionally, I also explored transient analysis of first-order circuits and apply circuit analysis in fields like analog, digital, and power 
                    electronics. Finally, I learned to develop electronics using circuit analysis techniques with development boards such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi,
                     bridging theory and practical application. I also bought another udmey course for power electronics where I learned, 
                     practical uses of rectifiers, DC-to-DC converters, and inverters. I learned to understand and analyze single-phase 
                     and three-phase rectifier circuits, as well as the functionality and operation of various DC-to-DC converters, 
                     including buck (step-down), boost (step-up), and buck-boost (step-down/up) circuits. Additionally, the course covers
                      single-phase and three-phase inverter circuits, providing me a thorough understanding of their design, 
                      analysis, and applications in power electronics. Below I added a download button, for my electrical book where I documented
                      most of my electrical work.

                <p>
                    In late 2022, I started a udmey course on TensorFlow & Machine Learning which was around 66 hours. In this course, 
                    I built TensorFlow models using computer vision, convolutional neural networks, and natural language processing. 
                    I learned how to integrate machine learning into tools and applications and developed various machine learning models using the latest 
                    TensorFlow 2. By building image and text recognition algorithms with deep neural networks and convolutional 
                    neural networks, I worked with real-world images to visualize how a computer "sees" information and plotted 
                    loss and accuracy to track model performance. I also applied deep learning techniques to time series forecasting. 
                    I have documented my learning on google collab, you can click the button below. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Then in 2024, I began researching 
                    reinforcement learning for my upcoming school project, I was able to find a book about reinforcement learning and
                    for the next 3 months I read through the entire book and learned  the fundamentals of reinforcement learning (RL),
                    starting with the key elements such as agents, environments, states, actions, and rewards. I explored the basic
                    concepts of RL and learned how it differs from other machine learning paradigms. The book introduced me to Markov
                    Decision Processes (MDP), including the Markov property, Markov chains, the Markov Reward Process, and the Markov 
                    Decision Process, which are foundational to understanding RL. I delved into the mathematical essentials of RL, 
                    including expectations, action space, policy types (deterministic and stochastic), and concepts like episodes,
                    horizons, and discount factors. I learned how to analyze the value function, Q function, and the differences
                    between model-based and model-free learning. I also explored various types of environments, such as deterministic
                    vs. stochastic, discrete vs. continuous, and single vs. multi-agent environments, as well as their applications
                    in different scenarios. The book provided a hands-on experience with the Gym toolkit, where I set up my machine,
                    installed Anaconda and the Gym toolkit, and created my first Gym environment. I explored various environments,
                    including classic control and Atari game environments, and learned how to generate episodes, select actions, and 
                    analyze state and action spaces. I even worked with more complex environments like Box2D, MuJoCo, and robotics, 
                    and implemented algorithms in these settings. I studied the Bellman equation in depth, including the value function,
                    Q function, and the Bellman optimality equation.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I applied dynamic programming techniques, such as value 
                        iteration and policy iteration, to solve problems like the Frozen Lake problem. The book also covered Monte 
                        Carlo methods, including prediction and control tasks, first-visit and every-visit Monte Carlo prediction, 
                        and the implementation of these methods in environments like the blackjack game in the Gym library. Understanding
                        temporal difference (TD) learning was another key part of the book. I learned about TD prediction and control 
                        algorithms, such as SARSA and Q-learning, and applied them to environments like the Frozen Lake Gym Environment. I compared the DP, 
                        MC, and TD methods to understand their strengths and weaknesses. The book also featured a case study on the multi-armed 
                        bandit (MAB) problem, where I explored various exploration strategies like epsilon-greedy, softmax exploration, upper 
                        confidence bound, and Thompson sampling. I applied these strategies to real-world problems, such as finding the best 
                        advertisement banner using bandits. In the deep learning foundations section, I explored the relationship between 
                        biological and artificial neurons, the structure of artificial neural networks (ANNs), and various activation 
                        functions. I learned about forward propagation in ANNs, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and convolutional neural 
                        networks (CNNs). I also delved into advanced topics like generative adversarial networks (GANs), understanding 
                        their architecture, and learning the loss functions.The book introduced me to TensorFlow, where I learned 
                        about computational graphs, sessions, variables, constants, placeholders, and TensorBoard for visualization. I 
                        built a handwritten digit classification model using TensorFlow and explored TensorFlow 2.0 with Keras for model 
                        definition, compilation, training, and evaluation. I further studied deep Q networks (DQN) and their variants, 
                        including double DQN, DQN with prioritized experience replay, and dueling DQN. I learned about replay buffers, 
                        loss functions, and target networks, and applied these concepts to playing Atari games using DQN. I also 
                        explored advanced techniques like deep recurrent Q networks.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The book covered policy gradient methods, 
                        including their intuition, derivation, and variance reduction methods. I implemented algorithms like policy 
                        gradient with reward-to-go and REINFORCE with baseline, applying them to tasks like cart-pole balancing. In the 
                        actor-critic methods section, I learned about advantage actor-critic (A2C) and asynchronous advantage actor-critic 
                        (A3C), exploring their architecture and applying them to environments like mountain car climbing. I also studied 
                        deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), twin delayed DDPG (TD3, the algorithim used for my project), 
                        and soft actor-critic (SAC), understanding their components, networks, and algorithms, and applying them to tasks like 
                        swinging up a pendulum. The book concluded with advanced topics like TRPO, PPO, and ACKTR methods, where I studied trust
                        region policy optimization, proximal policy optimization, and actor-critic using Kronecker-factored trust region. I also explored 
                        distributional reinforcement learning, including categorical DQN and quantile regression DQN, and applied these 
                        methods to Atari games. Finally, I studied imitation learning and inverse reinforcement learning, including 
                        supervised imitation learning, DAgger, deep Q learning from demonstrations, and maximum entropy inverse 
                        reinforcement learning. I explored generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) and its formulation. 
                        The book also introduced me to the Stable Baselines framework for deep reinforcement learning, where I 
                        created agents, evaluated, stored, and loaded trained models, and integrated custom environments. The book 
                        wrapped up with cutting-edge topics in reinforcement learning, such as meta reinforcement learning, model-agnostic 
                        meta learning (MAML), hierarchical reinforcement learning, and imagination-augmented agents, providing me with a 
                        deep understanding of the frontiers of reinforcement learning. All my reinforcement learning work can be downloaded

                <p>
                    My first experience in Web Development was when I was creating my portfolio, not this portfolio but my old
                    portfolio where I made a single page website but wasn't very knowledgeable in website designing and didn't know how to create
                    seperate pages for my content like projects or skills, hence why I created this new portfolio as I am more knowledgeable in html 
                    and css. Most of my html and css knowledge comes from youtube tutorials and taking on random projects. I also made a website for 
                    my church or non-profit organization recently. I had 2 weeks to create them a website and in the end I was able to 
                    produce a responive multi-page website that was specialized for their needs. The website can be seen below.

                <p>
                    I started getting into 3D modelling at around 8 years old where I created 3D models on a free 3D builder software 
                    on the appstore. Then in around the end of year 11, I found out about FreeCAD as before I thought you needed to pay
                    to use CAD software. I quickly realized I needed to learn CAD modelling as I needed to learn it for my upcoming 
                    project. So for the entire school holiday break, I spent my time learning FreeCAD from youtube tutorials. To test 
                    my new found skills, I attempted to make my upcoming project and get the design finished. All my desgins and parts I 
                    created can be found below.

                    In year 9, one of my electives was game design, at the time I was intrested on how games were modelled and coded. So
                    I attempted to create one myself, I decided to make an fps game much like CSGO but it was a combination between The CYCLE.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>I did pretty decently as over a period of several weeks, I developed an FPS game, starting with basic player 
                    setup and gun mechanics, and progressively adding more advanced features. Initially, I used standard assets 
                    to import an FPS player and equipped it with an AK-47 model, coding raycast shooting mechanics that detect 
                    hits on different objects. I created animations for idle and firing states, added muzzle flashes, and 
                    integrated sound effects for a more immersive experience.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>As the project progressed, I implemented a 
                    reloading mechanism, where bullets were tracked, and the gun would stop firing when out of ammo. In 
                    subsequent weeks, I worked on environmental details, such as realistic water physics, terrain enhancements, 
                    and detailed scenery elements like rocks and waterfalls, which were crucial in making the environment 
                    look more natural and engaging. I also introduced advanced mechanics like weapon sway and bullet impact 
                    effects, enhancing the game‚Äôs realism. Despite some difficulties, including hardware limitations, I was proud of 
                    my ability to quickly learn C#, to create a compelling game environment, and develop a unique and enjoyable gaming experience.

                    In year 11, our I.T teacher signed me up for both the Lockheed Martin cyersecurity competition and the Pecan+ 
                    cyberSecurity competition. So to prepare for the competition I practiced my cybersecurity skills on Grok. I learned 
                    various skills like decrypting, web exploits and cryptography. When the competition came, my team came 3rd in the 
                    Lockheed Martin cybersecurity competition and 1st place in the Pecan+ cybersecurity competition. With my new found skills
                    I was able to get into the Australian Signals Directorate cybersecurity and robotics program, where my skills were put
                    to test. As a group we were given a real case but altered for the program, where as a group we were given a phising email 
                    and we had to find the perpetrator. After 1 long week of learnign various different cybersecurity techniques and methods, we
                    were able to find the perpetrator and gave a 20min long presentation to a crowd, discussing what we found.

                    In year 9, me and a friend became really intrested in cryptocurrencies. We both decided that it would be fun if we 
                    could create our own. I started our cryptocurrency project by seting up essential tools like the Windows Subsystem
                    for Linux and VS Code, and ensured a strong foundation in JavaScript to prepare for complex coding scripts.

                <br>
                <p>In the blockchain development process, I‚Äôve created and tested blocks, implemented mining operations,
                    and integrated the SHA256 hash function to secure the blockchain. I‚Äôve also constructed and tested a
                    blockchain class, validated the chain, and implemented security measures to protect against 51% attacks.
                    I also worked on peer-to-peer networking includes setting up WebSocket servers, connecting blockchain peers, and 
                    synchronizing the blockchain across a distributed network. I‚Äôve implemented Proof of Work and dynamic block 
                    difficulty adjustment to ensure robust and scalable blockchain operations.

                <p>On the cryptocurrency side, I developed processes for wallet creation, key generation, and transaction 
                    management within a transaction pool. I focused on verifying and testing transactions, managing updates, 
                    and broadcasting transaction data across the network.
                    I‚Äôve also integrated Postman as a key tool, allowing for seamless interaction with the blockchain and 
                    cryptocurrency systems through API requests. This enables retrieval of blocks, mining operations, posting 
                    transactions, and more.</p>

                <p>
                    My first ever instance of being a data analyst was when I was in year 10. Where I was tasked by my I.T teacher to take a 
                    random dataset from ACT Open Data Portal and analyse and manipulate the data how I see fit. So I decided to take 
                    a bicycle crash dataset from the portal where it shows all the bicycle crashes that have happened in canberra over the 
                    past 10 years. I decided that I would try and find which political / electorate district had the most bicycle crashes. This 
                    seemed like an easy task until I realised that the location of the bicycle crashes only shows what street it happened on. Meaning 
                    I had to make a dataset where every I take every single street in Canberra, and organize them into their respective suburbs. After 
                    I did that I had to label each suburb into their respective political / electorate district. After 2 weeks of making and cleaning the 
                    dataset I was finally able to sort each bicycle crash into their respective political / electorate district. This project 
                    opened the gate for me on to create more systems where I had to make or clean datasets like in machine learning.

                <p>
                    My journey into Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) began with a desire to strengthen my logical thinking and 
                    problem-solving ability for engineering and software development. I started by learning how data structures like 
                    arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, and trees are used to organize and process data efficiently. 
                    Alongside this, I studied algorithmic principles such as recursion, sorting, searching, and dynamic programming, 
                    which form the foundation for tackling complex computational problems.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Over time, I expanded my knowledge to include topics such as greedy algorithms, divide and conquer, backtracking, 
                    graph theory, bit manipulation, and number theory. I learned how to analyze algorithmic efficiency using Big O 
                    notation and apply optimization techniques through approaches like sliding windows, two-pointers, prefix sums, 
                    and binary search. I also explored more advanced concepts like heap structures, tries, union-find, and segment 
                    trees, building a solid foundation for solving both theoretical and real-world challenges.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Today, I actively practice DSA on LeetCode, refining my ability to think algorithmically and design efficient, 
                    scalable solutions. My problem-solving process focuses on clarity, precision, and performance skills that 
                    continue to strengthen my development as both an engineer and programmer. Below is a folder of all the problems, 
                    I've solved documenting my implementation of the problem and the optimal solution to the problem.
