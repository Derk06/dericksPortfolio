                    Hello again! As you know I'm Derick Luke and on this page I will talk a bit more about me, my passion and life story.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    My passion ever since I was a kid was engineering, specifically making robots. I soon became intrested in the field of
                     Mechatronics which incorporates, mechanical, electrical and robotical engineering which sounded perfect for what I wanted to become.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Around 8th grade, I was introduced to python, before the only programming language I learnt was scratch. I learnt the basics
                    of python on youtube from a 4 hour course from free code camp. With that knowledge I set up a tutoring service to teach the kids 
                    in my neighbourhood python. After about a year of tutoring and honing my python skills, I became working on various projects like a 
                    motion tracking system where it uses a body detection system and tracks your motion. I then began working on my own cryptocurrency
                    with a friend as we were both intrested in cryptocurrencies.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Then in year 9, I was introduced to grok learning by my I.T teacher. Grok learning taught me a lot about programming since it was
                    a site that gave you questions and you had to coded out yourself using basic logic, a lot like leet coding, this gave me an insight
                    on how code runs and works and gave me a lot better visualization when I write code. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    For the rest of the year, I just practiced my python programming on Grok and I ventured into a new field which was
                    game development. I was slightly intrested in doing game development, so I chose game development as one of my subjects 
                    for school and started working on a game. It was just a simple 3D fps shooter game but it taught me a lot about game 
                    development and unity, this skill came in handy later on in the years when I wanted to make simulations for robots.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Then in year 10, I ventured into the field of computer science and data analytics, I practiced useful skills like how 
                    to use the pandas library, seaborn and matplotlib. This lead me onto cone of my first data analytics task set by my I.T teacher, 
                    the task was to get any datatset from ACT Open Data Portal and use the data and visualise it however you want. I decide to use a 
                    dataset where it records all bicycle crashes from all over canberra and then sort them into 4 electoral districts or political districts
                    to see which electoral district had the most bicycle crashes. This task took awhile as all the locations of the bicycle crashes were
                    recorded by what street the crash happened in. Meaning I had to find every single street in canberra and then sort each street by what
                    electoral district they are situated in and then sort all the bicycle crashes into their respected electoral district. This year also 
                    was the start of my development in electronics, since I knew I needed electronics if I wanted to do engineering. However, my school wasn't
                    teaching electronics at the time, so I took it into my own hands by buying and electronics course on udmey and learning electronics.
                    I also bought another udmey course which was a tensorflow & machine learning course and got through a good 30 hours of content while also doing
                    school work.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Then in year 11, I spent a lot of time learning various new skills in computer science like logic gates and created my
                    own JK-FLip-Flop in python, and multiple different questions and challenges on logic gates. I also learned about Big O and data structures and also
                    various different searching algorithism as well. I also learned how to use various components for Arduino like the temperature sensors, relays 
                    and IR sensors. I was then given a task to make a RPG game using OOP python for computer science and for robotics I tried to make a food delivery drone but wasn't able to complete 
                    it due to an injury. During year 11 I also ventured into a new field called reinforcement learning and started researching it for my computer science
                    projects, specifically Q-Learning and was able to recreate the algorithim from scratch. For Robotics, I decided I would try making a lane detection 
                    robot, where I use python to detect where the lane is turning using a raspberry pi and then send some instructions to the motors to turn in the direction
                    of the lane. At the end of the year I decided to learn CAD modelling on youtube, as I realised that next year we will have the oppertunity to make 1 year projects where we 
                    can work on one robot for the entire year, to prepare for this, I realised I would need to make specialized designs for my robot so I self-taught my self CAD modelling on
                    FreeCAD over the holidays.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In year 12, I fully put my focus on developing reinforcement learning systems. This year I had the ability to do 1 year project, where I can spend the whole
                    year developing one robot. I decided I would try and make a robot that can learn to walk by itself using reinforcement learning. This was difficult as the 
                    field of reinforcement learning was no walk in the park. I had to understand complex math that I haven't even learned in school and there wasn't much resources
                    on the subject either, only really simple implementation on basic algorithims. My robot had to use a specific algorithim called DDPG or Deep Deterministic Policy 
                    Gradient, so I had to find other resources. Thankfully I was able to get my hand on a reinforcement learning book that not only talks about the math behind the algorithims 
                    but also how to implement them in python as well. Since I had very little knowledge on reinforcement learning, I had to read through all 500 pages of the book and 
                    then figure out how I would implement my chosen algorithim into my robot. As of know I am currently building my self-learning robot.
